# Jumping Leprechauns

**Solve P-11.70 (page 534) - Using an AVL tree.**

This simulation involves n leprechauns, numbered 1 to n. It maintains a gold value gi for each leprechaun i, which begins with each leprechaun starting out with a million dollars worth of gold, that is, g<sub>i</sub> = 1,000,000 for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

In addition, the simulation also maintains, for each leprechaun, i, a place on the horizon, which is represented as a double-precision floating-point number, xi. In each iteration of the simulation, the simulation processes the leprechauns in order from 1 to n. Initially, xi is calculated as x<sub>i</sub> = 1000000*r , where *r is a random floating-point number between −1 and 1*.

Processing a leprechaun i during this iteration begins by computing a new place on the horizon for i, which is determined by the assignment x<sub>i</sub> = x<sub>i</sub> + rg<sub>i</sub> , where r is a random floating-point number between −1 and 1. The leprechaun i then steals half the gold from the nearest leprechauns on either side of him on the horizon and adds this gold to his gold value, g<sub>i</sub>.

Write a program that can perform a series of iterations in this simulation for a given number, n, of leprechauns. 

* You must maintain the set of horizon positions using an AVL tree data structure with the horizon positions as the key. 
* Implement before() and after() methods to look at the horizon positions. **These will need to be added to the AVL tree**
* The corresponding value for the key-value pair of the AVL node could be an object that stores the leprechaun number and its gold value. **You will need to modify the AVL tree**

You do not need to write the AVL tree implementation. It is included in this repository.

Below is a Sample Output: 

```
